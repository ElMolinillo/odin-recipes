    <h1>Double Cheese</h1>
    <img src="../img/double-cheese.png" alt="just cheese bro or sis delicious" width="400px">
    <p>This is similar to lasagna. It's fairly easy to prepare, and my <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/18804/double-cheese-casserole/">this person's picky eaters</a> love it! The cheeses are cream cheese and cottage cheese, which enables you to control the fat content without cutting on flavor. Garnish with some grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.</p>
