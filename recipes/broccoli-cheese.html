    <h1>Broccoli-Cheese Casserole</h1>
    <img src="../img/broccoli-cheese.png" alt="noice casserole of broccoli with ton of cheese" width="400px">
    <p>For the longest time, <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/260458/easy-broccoli-cheese-casserole/">someone's mum</a> would make this amazing broccoli casserole. It is more like a crustless quiche, but has converted many broccoli haters into broccoli lovers! I have not ever tweaked this recipe - not even to add minced garlic, sauteed onion, pimento, etc; it's too simple and delicious on its own to need tweaking. This can be made ahead and refrigerated before cooking. It freezes well and can be thawed prior to cooking.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 head broccoli, chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) container cottage cheese</li>
        <li>3 eggs </li>
        <li>½ (8 ounce) package shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large bowl with ice water to create an ice bath.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add broccoli and cook, uncovered, until bright green and tender, about 3 minutes. Drain in a colander and immediately immerse in the ice bath for several minutes to stop the cooking process. Drain.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish with vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>Combine broccoli, cottage cheese, eggs, Cheddar cheese, butter, flour, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Spread into the prepared casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 60 to 90 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
